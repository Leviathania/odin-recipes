    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>La Farinata also known as La Cecina in Tuscany is an Italian snack that's super nostalgic to me because it's from
        my hometown. It's the most incredible chickpea flatbread made with just 3 basic ingredients. It's crispy and
        delicious on the outside with the most delicious creamy middle.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Chickpea flour</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Water</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Olive oil</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Salt</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Sift the flour into a bowl, chickpea flour has a very chalky texture so this helps remove lumps.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk together the chickpea flour, salt and water (add the water gradually to avoid any lumps) when the
            batter is nice and smooth add the olive oil and stir together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Leave the batter to rest for 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the flatbread batter into a well oiled, thin pizza tray or baking tray no more than 0.5mm thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the oven for 20 minutes until it's nice and golden on top.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle over some coarse salt and some rosemary sprigs (optional) followed by a drizzle of olive oil. Cut
            into slices and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
