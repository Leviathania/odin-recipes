    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Lasagne al Forno is the perfect meal for Sunday dinner, the rich beef ragu can simmer away while you prepare the
        bechamel sauce and if you feel like going all out you can even make homemade pasta too. </p>
    <p>It's truly special.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Ragu or meat sauce</strong> - the beef ragu takes around 10-15 minutes to prep (cutting the veg,
            browning the meat
            etc) but once you've done that you leave it to simmer away for a few hours while you get on with your day,
            easy!
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pasta</strong> - if you're making homemade pasta then the prep time is increased significantly which
            is fine if
            you're having a fun day of cooking but if you want as less prep as possible then use pre-bought fresh
            lasagna sheets/noodles. You can use dried but I recommend using fresh, see my notes below on why.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bechamel sauce </strong> - this lasagna is a traditional Italian version so it's made with bechamel
            sauce
            and NOT
            ricotta cheese. You'll see ricotta used in Italian-American recipes. Don't worry though making a bechamel
            sauce from scratch takes no more than 10 mins and it can be prepped in advance or just before you are ready
            to assemble the dish.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the rag√π:</strong> Finely chop the carrot, celery and onion and sweat slowly with a little
            olive oil in a large,
            deep skillet or pan. Once you've sauteed the veggies, add the meat and brown whilst breaking it up with a
            wooden spoon. Add the red wine and reduce by half. Once the wine has reduced, add the sieved tomatoes,
            tomato paste, bay leaf, 4 cups of the beef stock and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir everything together
            and leave to simmer on a low heat for 2.5-3 hours uncovered. Add the rest of the beef stock half way
            through.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the bechamel sauce:</strong> Add the butter to a saucepan and cook until melted and bubbling.
            Add the flour to
            the melted butter and stir to form a paste. Let the flour cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk half of the milk
            into the butter and flour constantly whisking to avoid any lumps. Once it has started to thicken add the
            rest of the milk, nutmeg, parmesan and a pinch of salt and pepper. Continue to heat the sauce whilst
            stirring until thickened enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Take off the heat and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assemble and cook the lasagne:</strong> To assemble the lasagne, spoon a small amount of ragu on the
            very bottom of the baking
            dish. Top with and even layer of lasagna pasta sheets. Add a few more spoons of ragu so the pasta is
            completely covered followed by white sauce. Repeat the layers of pasta, ragu and bechamel sauce finishing
            with a layer of pasta topped with bechamel sauce (you should have 4-5 layers of pasta). Cover the top layer
            of the lasagne with torn mozzarella and then bake in the oven until bubbling and golden.
