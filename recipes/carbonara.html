    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is one of four famous Roman dishes the other three being; Cacio e Pepe, Pasta alla Gricia and
        Amatriciana.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Spaghetti</strong> - if you don't have spaghetti you can use whatever pasta you have on hand,
            Rigatoni or Mezze Maniche are good options.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Guanciale</strong> - Guanciale is cured Italian pork jowl (cheek) whereas more commonly found
            pancetta, is cured pork belly. It's unbelievably delicious and has a stronger flavour than pancetta. It's
            also very fatty but that's where all the beautiful flavour is (the fat is crucial). It's sold in whole
            pieces or slices and you should be able to find it in most Italian speciality food stores just make sure you
            get a thick enough piece to cut it into ¼ inch (½ cm) thick cubes or strips. You need guanciale to truly
            experience authentic spaghetti alla carbonara but good quality pancetta can also be used just make sure it
            has plenty of fat and cut it in the same way as mentioned above.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Eggs</strong> - some recipes use whole eggs and some use just the yolk which makes it richer.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pecorino romano</strong> - made from sheep milk it's tangy, salty and delicious and it's another key
            ingredient to make the traditional dish. If it's not easy to find though, Parmigiano Reggiano can be used
            instead (or a mixture of both).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Black pepper</strong> - freshly ground tastes best.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add the spaghetti, cook until al dente (around 7 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, add the guanciale to a hot skillet and fry until brown and crispy then turn off the heat (do not
            drain the fat).
        </li>
        <li>
            While the guanciale is frying add the eggs, pecorino and pepper to a bowl, whisk until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the pasta is ready, remove it with kitchen tongs to the skillet with the guanciale and toss so it's
            well combined in the fat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, add the egg mixture whilst tossing the pasta to ensure the eggs don't scramble. Once the sauce turns
            glossy and creamy it's ready, add extra pecorino and pepper to serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
